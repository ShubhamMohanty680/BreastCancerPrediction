# 📄✏ Breast Cancer Detection Project
**Brief:** The Breast dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains nearly all the PLCO study data available for breast cancer incidence and mortality analyses. For many women the trial documents multiple breast cancers, however, this file only has data on the earliest breast cancer diagnosed in the trial. The dataset contains one record for each of the approximately 78,000 women in the PLCO trial.

The breast cancer dataset is a classic and very easy binary classification dataset.This dataset uses a machine learning algorithm to classify cancer scans as benign(0) or malignant(1).

#### Dataset is taken from Kaggle and stored in Mongodb
